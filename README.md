# PyTorch Tutorials

A collection of PyTorch tutorials and code snippets. This repository was created during the DS423 Machine Learning Driven Data Analysis II course at the department of Software Engineering of Daffodil International University, Dhaka.

Many of the codes are borrowed from the wonderful book [Deep Learning for Coders with Fastai and PyTorch](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Coders-fastai-PyTorch/dp/1492045527) by Jeremy Howard & Sylvain Gugger.
